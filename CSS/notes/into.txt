CSS - cascading style Sheets used for styling/design/layout of the web page

How do you link /apply CSS to HTML?
we can do by three ways
1. inline Styling: It applies style properties with 'style' as a attribute
Eg:
<h1 style="background-color: red;color: yellow;">Hello World</h1>

2. internal styling: You Can Apply styling Internally in head as 'style' as a element
<style>
        h1
        {
            color: rgb(49, 83, 221);
        }
    </style>

3. External CSS: We can mention CSS externally as .css file and link it in HTML in head
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./first.css">

inline > internal > external

How do CSS exactly selects elements?
Basic Selectors: 
 tag name:  you can select elements by tag name
 class name: you can select elements by class name but for classname , you should mention as .classname
 id name: you can select elements by id name but for id name, you should mention as #idname

 id > class > tagname

 Box Model: Every Element in Web page is consider as a BOX.
 Box contains some content along with padding,border,margin
Border: border will have width, type and color of the border, it is outermost line of the Box
eg: border:2px solid red;
Padding: padding is nothing but space between content and border(internal space).
you can specify padding by padding-left,padding-right,padding-bottom,padding-top
padding:10px will take 10px padding in all sides
padding:10px 20px 
   ---> tb(10px) lr(20px)
padding:10px 20px 30px;
   ----> t(10px) lr(20px) b(30px)
padding:10px 20px 30px 40px;
        t      r    b   l

margin: margin is the gap outside the border
you can also apply margin similar as padding

Box- sizing: when we apply some padding, it might increase height / width of an element, to avoid that we can assign box-sizing as border-box(by default it is content box)
