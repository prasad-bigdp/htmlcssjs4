we can use display property to make elements block,inline or inline-block or table or none

but we have respnsive layout options like flexbox

flex is used to arrange child items in single direction flexibly

To do this, we should give display flex to parent
flex-direction : defines the direction in which child items arranged.(row/column/row-reverse/column-reverse)
flex-wrap: defines whether we want to wrap the elements or not(nowrap/wrap/wrap-reverse)
flex-flow: flex-direction flex-wrap;
There are two axis , main axis(flex-direction), cross axis(opp.flex-direction)

justify-content: move the items towards main-axis
jusity-items: move the items towards main axis with wrap
align-items : move the items towards cross axis
align-content: move the items towards cross axis with wrap
gap: gap- between the elements

child properties:
flex-grow: makes how much growth a single item can have
flex-shrink : makes how much shrink a single item can have
flex- basis: fixed width of a single item
order: number by which elements are arrange. by default order is 1
justify-self: move single item along main axis
align-self: move single item along cross axis
