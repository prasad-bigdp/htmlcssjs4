tables are used to represent the data in a simpler ways, we can use rows and columns in table. rows are horizontal ones and columns are vertical ones
whole table is defined by "table" tag,
table contains "tr" to represents table rows
table rows contains "th" or "td" to represent table headings or table data.
by default th will be bold and cenetered
to combine two columns , we can use colspan
and for rows, we can use "rowspan"
To see the table border , you can give attribute "border" to table
table can also contains attributes like cellspacing and cellpadding
Title of the table can be mentioned by caption
