Data types defines the type of data the variable holds
There are categories of data types
 i. primitve data types: There are primarily 5 primitve data types
    a. number: any numerical value(integer/decimal) is number data type
    number data type have default methods:
    toFixed(no-of-decimal-digits)
    toPrecision(no-of-digits from starting)
    toString(base to convert from decimal)

    we can also use math methods like sqrt,cbrt,ceil,floor,round,pow,random,max,min etc..,

    2. strings:  strings are declared in three ways
    single quotation / double quotation / backtick

    There is no differnece between single or double quotations but we use it based on situation. backticks are part of template literal. template literal is a Es6 feature used to print value of a variable without breaking the paragraph

    strings store the individual characters like array with index values
    let str="PRASAD"

    the popular string methods are length, toUpperCase,toLowerCase, indexOf,lastIndexOf,charAt,slice,split,replace,replaceAll,trim,endsWith,startsWith

    c. boolean: boolean is used to store true/false. 1 means true and 0 means false
    d. undefined: undefined represents accidental absence of value
    e. null: null represents complete absence of value
 ii. non- primitve data types
