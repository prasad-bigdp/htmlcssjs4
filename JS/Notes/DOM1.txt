Document Object Model(DOM):
Browser also copies HTML and CSS and stores in one object called document
To undertsand DOM, we need to Understand 4 important things
 a. events: Events are the triggering points and based on certain user actions, these events triggers different functionalities.
  Events can be represented in two ways
  i. event handlers: Event handlers are events that are presented in HTML
  <button onclick="fun()">click me</button>
  ii. event listener: Event listners are events that are presented in Javascript
  selectedElemenet.addEventListner('click',callback)












 b. DOM selection: Document elements can be accessed/selected from HTML to Javascript by 5 ways
   i. getElementsByTagName: it returns values in HTMLCollection Array and we can access any element using index
   ii. getElementsByClassName: it returns values in HTMLCollection Array and we can access any element using index 
   iii.getElementById: it returns values/ element alone since id is unique
   iv. querySelector: it returns only first element that satisfies the given query
   v. querySelectorAll: it returns all elements which satisfies the query in a array of NodeList
 c. DOM Manipulation: We can even manipulate through DOM by following ways
   i.textContent: it is used to access/ update the text inside selected element
   ii. innerText: it is used to access/ update the text inside the selected element. the difference is  it also access CSS , so that if in case visibility hidden it cannot see the text
   iii. innerHTML. using innerHTML, you can add HTML code and it will be executed and added to DOM
   iv. value: if you want to access values, you can use value for input elements
   v. style: it is used to access/update style of the selected element
   vi. classList: we can add any class/remove any class/toggle any class using classList
 d. DOM creation
