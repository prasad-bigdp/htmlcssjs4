if we want to cook some item eg: biryani, list out ingedients and run process

similarly JS engine always tops out your declarations

The process of moving declaration of variables, functions,classes to the top of your code before executing the code is called hoisting. To say simply, you can use values before declaration

Global Execution Content maintained by window object will perform hoisting and will execute the whole code

normal functions use local execution content. to manage multiple execution content , js uses stack called call stack. it follows Last in first Out

let and const values also follows hoisting but you cannot access them because they will be temporal dead zone
