Loops are used to iterate/repeat certain statements multiple times
Each time is called one iteration
it runs until given condition is false
there are two types of Loops
i. Entry Control Loops:Entry Control loop checks condition at the starting of the loop
  a. while loop:
   eg: i=1; //initialization
   while(i<=10){ //condition
    console.log(i++) //updation
   }
  b. for loop:
  for(initialization;condition;updation)
  {
    //statements
  }
ii. Exit control Loop:Entry Control loop checks condition at the ending of the loop
  a. do-while:
  eg: i=11;
  do{
    console.log(i++);
  }while(i<=10)
