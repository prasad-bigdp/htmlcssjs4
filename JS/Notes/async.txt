JS is a synchronous(line by line) , Single Threaded (one task at a time )Language

Asynchronous functions will take some time to execute. every asynchronous returns a promise

let's learn  asynchronous by Timers

setTimeOut,setInterval,clearTimeout,clearInterval

A Promise is an Object which describes an eventual completion of an asynchronous function
  eg: new Promise(function(resolve,reject){
    resolve("hai");
    reject("bye")
  })

  API(Application Programming Interface):

  Applications get data from another applications or from backend using an endpoint

  for Eg:In this https://api.quotable.io/random, https://api.quotable.io is domain, /random is called endpoint. this point contains data either in XML or JSON(Javscript Object Notation - all keys are strings) format
